# JPD Honeypot project : Penetration-Testing-on-Web-Application
Penetration testing, Attacked as RED team and Defensed as BLUE team on web application.

****************************************************************************************
JPD Honeypot project is a customer management system (CMS) project that is managing cyber related information for TAFE using dynamic applications to create new subjects and pages. JPD Honeypot project is fully encrypted to secure from brute force, SQL-injection, cross scripting attacks. JPD Honeypot project has management control on the application through administrator login to perform the basic CRUD operations on the application with public view contents in read only or select only mode. 

There are two sections in the administration interface which provide detailed information of subjects and pages to dynamically create, remove and update (CRUD) user interface. Project is using a well-maintained user interface for TAFE students and administrator interface which can add new subjects and pages to display in static mode. Interface provides the view to add new subjects and pages to update and delete the new pages. 

We are using a specific database for the project named cyber_at2 which contains three tables named pages, subjects, and admins. admin table used to provide the authentication for the authorized user to use and modify the application data. Pages and subjects tables will contain the data for the pages and subjects. MySQL data is a structured collection of records or data stored in a computer systema and organized in such a way that we can quickly search, and information can be rapidly retrieved. The database contains the record of users who would be authorized to access the application. The database contains the pages and subjects data.

JPD honeypot sanitation project is a fully customer management system. We are using HTML, PHP and JavaScript for our programming language and MySQL as a database. At the end we are sanitizing the PHP code using different strategies like manual code review, update code for SQL injection, code reusable, encode the URLs and encrypt passwords, use secure shell SSL authentication, secure session.

JPD honeypot project using the mitigation technologies to avoid attacks such as SQL-injection, brute-force and session-jacking attacks for the web server and system of CITE MS Pty Ltd.
DevSecOps is a practice of integrating security into continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment pipeline with integrated security in each phase. DevSecOps integrate active security audits and security testing into agile development and DevOps workflows so that security is built into the product. To implement DevSecOps, teams should introduce security throughout the software development lifecycle in order to minimize vulnerabilities in software code. Enable automated security checks at each stage of the DevOps pipeline: plan, build, test, deploy, operate, and observe.

The conclusion of the exercise is that when we are creating an application, we need to use the Develops framework which helps us to identify the steps to build a secure application and test the application. The application has different parts such as development, database design and testing. There are various tools available to test vulnerabilities in the application, but we can use the tools which analyze the system and provide us the detail of vulnerabilities related to MySQL, secure coding and methods in the code required to change. 

DevSecOps provides us the way to interact with iteration approach where we can test design, code and test the code and implement as per user acceptance. 

As our finding of vulnerabilities, which could be because of misconfiguration, insecure code, inadequately designed architecture and disclosure of sensitive information. So, our action is to fix all the vulnerabilities from our application and sensitize code to avoid the risk of attack.
